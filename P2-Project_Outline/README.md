### Overview
LABrador : Lab management software as reliable as man's best friend

This facet of LABrador is just one part of what will become a comprehensive lab management tool.
LABrador will provide to its users a simple, yet thorough means of keeping track of laboratory animal colonies via a database.
Each lab member will have a unique login, but will be able to connect with information shared by other members of the same lab.
This application will be web-based and free, both of which are hard to come by for the frugal scientist.
This application has the potential to expand into lab manager's best friend, as it will provide a one-stop-shop for all lab management needs,
including but not limited to:
- a hub for inter-lab communications/scheduling
- a place to track chemical/equipment inventory
- a place to share lab research and research of interest
- a means of storing protocols and other lab documents
Stop forgetting usernames and passwords for 8 different lab-related websites and just choose LABrador!git
